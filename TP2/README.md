# Description

This project simulates a traffic signal circuit using an Arduino board. The circuit consists of three lights: red, yellow, and green, which illuminate sequentially to control traffic flow. The red light indicates stop, the yellow light signals to prepare to stop, and the green light indicates vehicles can proceed.

## Features

- Simulation of a traffic signal with sequential light control.
- Utilizes a light sensor to adjust the brightness of the lights based on ambient light conditions.
- Ability to adjust the timing of light flashes to simulate different traffic scenarios.

## Required Hardware

- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) and appropriate resistors
- A light sensor (LDR - Light Dependent Resistor)
- A push-button (optional)

## How to Use

1. Connect the LEDs (red, yellow, and green) to the digital pins of the Arduino board.
2. Connect the light sensor to an analog pin of the Arduino board.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Power the Arduino board and observe the traffic light operation.
