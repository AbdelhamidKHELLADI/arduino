# Smart Parking System

![Smart Parking System](prototype.jpg)

## Overview

The Smart Parking System project aims to automate parking space management using Arduino technology. This system incorporates an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor, a servo motor, and a 7-segment display to detect vehicle presence, control parking barriers, and display parking space availability in real-time.

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection:** The LDR sensor detects the presence of vehicles entering or leaving parking spaces.
- **Automated Barrier Control:** The servo motor automatically opens and closes parking barriers based on vehicle presence.
- **Real-time Status Display:** A 7-segment display provides visual feedback on parking space availability.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The system offers a convenient interface for efficient parking space management.

## Components Used

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- LDR sensor
- Servo motor
- 7-segment display
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## How it Works

1. **Vehicle Detection:** The LDR sensor detects changes in light intensity caused by vehicles entering or leaving parking spaces.
2. **Barrier Control:** The Arduino board processes the sensor data and commands the servo motor to open or close the parking barrier accordingly.
3. **Status Display:** Simultaneously, the Arduino updates the status of the parking space on the 7-segment display, indicating whether it is vacant or occupied.
4. **User Interaction:** Users can easily identify available parking spaces based on the displayed information and proceed with parking.
